# Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that solve optimization problems by making the locally optimal choice at each step. Greedy algorithms are often used to solve problems that have optimal substructure, meaning that the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions to its subproblems. However, greedy algorithms do not always produce the optimal solution, and may not even produce a feasible solution.
