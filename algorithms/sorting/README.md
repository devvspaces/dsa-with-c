# Sorting

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a particular order. The most common orderings are numerical (ascending or descending) and lexicographical (dictionary order). Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists.
