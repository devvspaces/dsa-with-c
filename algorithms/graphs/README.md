# Graph Algorithms

Graphs are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They are used to model many real-world problems, including computer networks, social networks, and transportation networks. Graphs are composed of vertices (nodes) and edges (links between nodes). Graphs can be directed (edges have a direction) or undirected (edges have no direction). Graphs can also be weighted (edges have a weight) or unweighted (edges have no weight).
